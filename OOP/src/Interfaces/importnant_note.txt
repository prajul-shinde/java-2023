new features: 

- interfaces can have fields (by default they are static and final)
- they can have private and static methods

- with new features interfaces have lost their meaning and lotta people are abusing the to achieve multiple inheritance.

why do you think that: people are using it as hack to achive multiple inhertance. but interfaces should not be
 confused with class we should keep them as contract so we can minimize the impact of changes so we can build loosly coupled applications
 so if we change how we do something we not gonna end up breaking code or recompilation in code.

when to use interfaces?

- when you wanna decouple class from its dependencies. benefit: 
    - easily swap one implementation with another. encoding vdo with different algorithm
    -easily extend applications. eg new tax calculator
    - test classes in isolation. if you are using email service we can decouple it from dependencies and test in isolation.
